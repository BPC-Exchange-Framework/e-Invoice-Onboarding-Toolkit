A primer to the Four-Corner Model Framework for handling e-invoices.The ___Four-Corner Model Framework___ provides a mechanism for a Seller to transmit an invoice in electronic format to a Buyer.  The Frameworks seeks to address potential issues such as network relibaility and security questions such as a authentication and non-repudiation.  In Corner #1 is the Seller, iniating the process.  In Coner #4 is the  Buyer, the termiinal endpoint of the process.Corner #2 and Conrner #3 are Access Points.   Access Point #1  is in Corner #2 and Access Point #2 is in Corner #3.   Two additional types of service providers in the Framework are the Service Metadata Locator or "SML" and the Service Metatadata Publisher or "SMP."  The SML is  a NAPTR record, or a specilizd DNS entry which when queried correctly  provide the URI for the SMP.    The SML is a  DNS query.  The SMP is a website which when queried returns the service capability of the buyer to receive the e-invvoice and the terminal URI  for forwarding.  This URI is is Access Point number #2 in  Corner #3.  The query to the SMP is in the form of a SOAP API call.  Two requests are made to the SMP as spcified by the framework.  The message transmitted to the final endpoint must utilize the AS4 message protocol.  The protoocl specfifies an XML format message header as a "wrapper" for the message.  The SMP and the SML fuctionality are not necessairly povided by either of the Access Points.  In that sense they are not in any corner per se.  Since the SML is literally a DNS look-up of a key:value pair in a registrered domain, once the key:value pair is created on the domain it is accessible via DNS look-up to anyone on the world with the knowlddge of construciting the query.  The Access Points are service providers which in term provide access to other third party proivders of services which are further defined within the framework.  These additional service providers are defined by the Framework
