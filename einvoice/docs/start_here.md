# Getting Started With The e-Invoice Onboarding Tool-kit
## (Or, So You Think You Want to Be an Access Point)

***
### Welcome!
Thank you for your interest and participation in developing an e-Invoice Onboarding Tool-kit!
Please just jump in.  We're trying to make the tool-kit as easy to implement and use as possible.  That's a tall order out of the gate, but we're going to try. If something is unclear or deosn't make sense about the download, installation, execution of the software, please let us know.   
We look foward to working with you!

### Goals
The unofficial goal (as a developer) of the e-Invoice Tool-kit is to demystify (where we can) the 4-Corners e-Invoice processing model through examples of how processing some of the different steps could be done.  


### Caveats
This is a work in progress.  
The 4-Corners Model for e-Invoice processing is pretty complex.  
We have been balancing taking bites that we can chew verus trying to get the whole thing, or even just portions of it, in one go.  
There will be gaps at first.  The hope is that we will pick up speed as we go, and the community will give feedback in terms of priorty and directon for areas of focus.
