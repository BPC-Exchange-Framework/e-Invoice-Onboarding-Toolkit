## Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab<hr/>


### Colab Sandboxes
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) pages which implement [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) have been created as sandboxes to demonstrate implementation of the code without deploying a development or virtual environment. 

#### urn creation, hashing, and naptr query to SML
Colab page with examples of how to hash the specification, the schema_id, and the party_id to create the urn and perform the natpr dns query is at this [Colab page](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kfMedMUapeaOS6u9hnS8IcmQaury8znP?usp=sharing).  Examples 6, 7, 8,  and 9 run the hash and submit against DNS in real-time.  

#### SMP query
Colab page with examples of how to transform the urn and party_id and submit it to the SMP uri is at this [Colab page](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14EVSc0GyjU0H9776UEXqoEoD3x5Kn2RV?usp=sharing).
