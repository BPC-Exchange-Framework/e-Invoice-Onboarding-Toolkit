### Diving in to the E-Invoice On-boarding Toolkit

#### About  
This project offers examples of Python code written to interact with an access point or discovery service of a 4-Corners Payment Model ("Model").   

See the the [Business Payments Coalition](https://businesspaymentscoalition.org/) website for more information and fuller explanation of the Model.  

#### Assumptions  

##### The 4-Corners Model  
The software included with the project assumes a baseline understanding of the Model.  

##### Python     
A baseline knowledge of Python and programming are implicit in coming to [github.com](https://github.com/BPC-OpenSourceTools/e-Invoice-Onboarding-Toolkit) to pull code down to review and implement.   This wiki and additional documentation are intended to further outline how the software in the Toolkit is designed to implement the Model.
