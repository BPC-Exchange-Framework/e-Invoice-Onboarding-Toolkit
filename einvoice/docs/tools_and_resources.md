## Getting started

The goal is to create, test, deploy, and maintain code to the highest professional standards.

To do that we need to agree on a set of tools and practices to enable repeatable and reproducible code.

### Cheat Sheet

| The Basics | The Details |
| --- | --- |
| Programming Language | Python 3.6 or above. |
| Computer | Supports runnng Python 3.6 or above. |
| OS  | Mac, Windows, or Windows w/WSL2. |
| Documents and resources. | GitHub and [BPC-Technical-Workgroup-Folder - Google Drive](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fdrive%2Ffolders%2F15aJogTieUuqukjDHm5AVQVVm-PVukPs9&data=04%7C01%7C%7C0ce76ff21ff048af0c2b08d8ef9790ff%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637522781535891404%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=l1%2BAoHrIHr8przKXkn6pSCQTGnGXKMcOjQnzY0jpqws%3D&reserved=0) |

### Programming Languages

The initial development of the project is being done in Python.

Additional development in Go and adoption and implementation of cloud methodologies utilizing Amazon Web Services are considered stretch goals within the scope of the Project.

All effort will be made to remain within the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/index.html). Inclusion of other well known packages with an open source license is acceptable if necessary.

#### Version of Python

***Select a minimum version of Python 3.6. This will include newer features such as f-string.***

### Computer Spec

* You will need a computer which is able to download and run Python 3.6.

### Operating System

* Mac
* Windows
* Windows w/WSL2
* Linux

#### Additional Configuration and Environment Considerations

Consideration and implementation of additional Python enabling technology includes:

##### Frameworks:

* Django
* Flask
* FastAPI
* OpenAPI
* AWS Lambdas

##### Containerization and Cloud Services:

* Docker

Running on a cloud service such as:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Microsoft Azure
* RedHat OpenShift

Local testing of Docker containerization may be done on a desktop, however a contianer running on cloud implementation is the natural endpoint for a container deployment.

Additional infrastructure components may be implemented for test or prototyping utilizing a cloud service.

The choice of provider and implementation of a cloud service is entirely the responsibility of the implementer of the code. Code artifacts included here which implement cloud services are examples for research and educational purposes only.

#### Python Programming Methodologies, Standards, and Tools:

Some standards:

* PEP20
* PEP8

Tools to implement the standards

* Flake8
* Pylint
* Pytest
* docstrings

Development methodologies

* Domain Driven Design
* Test Driven Development
* Agile principle

#### Books

There's no shortage of reference materials in print and on the Internet about Python development. The list below contains some of the titles the developers consider the most helpful and authoritative regardless of level of expertise with Python. (Titles and author only, no affiliate links.)

* The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python
* Serious Python
* Domain Driven Design Distilled
* Domain Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software
* Test Driven Development with Python
* Architecture Patterns with Python
* Pro Git
