# Diving in to the e-Invoice Onboarding Toolkit

#### About  
This project offers examples of Python code written to interact with an access point or discovery service of a Four-Corner Model.   

Please see the [Business Payments Coalition](https://businesspaymentscoalition.org/electronic-invoices/) website for more information and an explanation of the Model.  

#### Assumptions  

##### The Four-Corner Model  
The software included with the project assumes a baseline understanding of the Four-Corner Model and its constituent components.  

##### Python     
The primary programming language chosen for the project is Python.  To implement and run the code in [this project](https://github.com/BPC-OpenSourceTools/e-Invoice-Onboarding-Toolkit) requires a working knowledge of Python. This wiki and additional documentation are intended to further outline how the software is designed to implement the Four-Corner Model.
