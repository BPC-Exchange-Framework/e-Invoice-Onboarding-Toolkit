# Creating a common Dev environment

The are a lot of ways to configure a Development environment.  The goal is to create a list of common tools which are widely available for low-cost or free to provide baseline to create, debug, test, deploy, and maintain to the highest professional standards.


**Cheat Sheet**
The What| The What of the What
--------|----------------------
Programming Language | Python 3.6 or above.  Go lang support in future
Computer | Anything that will run Python
OS | Mac, Windows, or Windows w/WSL2.  Chrome or Raspberry Pi - your ambitious enough - you got that.
Documents | GitHub and [BPC-Technical-Workgroup-Folder - Google Drive](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fdrive%2Ffolders%2F15aJogTieUuqukjDHm5AVQVVm-PVukPs9&data=04%7C01%7C%7C0ce76ff21ff048af0c2b08d8ef9790ff%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637522781535891404%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=l1%2BAoHrIHr8przKXkn6pSCQTGnGXKMcOjQnzY0jpqws%3D&reserved=0)

**Programming Languages:**   
The initial development of the project is being done in Python.  Additional development in Go and adoption of cloud methodologies utilizing Amazon Web-services are considered stretch goals within the scope of the Project.   

All effort will be made to remain within the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/index.html).  Inclusion of other well known packages with an open source license is acceptable if necessary.  These would include [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/). [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/), and similar.  

***Select a minimum version of Python 3.6.  This will include newer features such as f-string.***
