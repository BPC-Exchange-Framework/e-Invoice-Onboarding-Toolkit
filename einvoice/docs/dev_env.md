**Programming Languages:**   
The initial development of the project is being done in [Python](https://www.python.org/).  Additional development in Go and adoption of cloud methodologies utilizing Amazon Web-services are considered stretch goals within the scope of the Project.   

All effort will be made to remain within the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/index.html).  Inclusion of other well known packages with an open source license is acceptable if necessary.  These would include [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/). [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/), and similar.  

***Select a version of [Python greater than 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  This will include newer features such as f-string.***
